Her official biography from her time on the show reads, “Jess is a sweet soul from Orlando, Florida, who says Zach is her dream man! While Jess is one of the younger women, she is mature, knows what she wants in a partner and doesn’t want to settle for anything less than her soul mate. Jess describes herself as a hopeless romantic and is ready for her fairytale romance worthy of a Taylor Swift love song. Jess comes from a big Puerto Rican family and hopes Zach is ready for her to spice up his life. Jess hopes Zach is as excited about her as she is about him!”</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Although Jess was eliminated in week six on The Bachelor, she sure made a splash (no pun intended) by joining the cast of Bachelor In Paradise season 9, instantaneously sparking up a connection with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blake Moynes</a>, despite <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean McLaughlin</a> trying time and time again to pursue her (using the fact that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they’re both Swifties</a> as a means for flirting).</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>While things seemed to be smooth sailing between Jess and Blake, things quickly took a turn during the episode on November 30, where the duo ended up terminating their relationship once and for all — yikes!</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>After his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ex-fiancé</a> and former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelorette</a> lead, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Thurston</a>, hit the beach, Blake Moynes got the clarity he needed, determining that his relationship with Jess Girod was nowhere near where it should be during that point in the competition — after all, proposals are just a few days away!</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>Because of this, Jess and Blake amicably split from one another, in what might have been the most mature breakup in the history of Bachelor In Paradise. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Given that Jess is only 24 years old</a>, she has garnered the nickname “Baby Jess” (as mentioned previously), but after showing so much poise in her breakup with Blake, is it fair to continue to call her that?</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>After showing some disdain towards those who call her “Baby Jess” during the infamous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachelor In Paradise roast battle</a> a few episodes prior, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bartender</a> of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wells Adams</a>, weighed in on the situation, determining whether or not this nickname is actually offensive.

I mean look at me, I’m almost&nbsp;40 and still do a lot of fart jokes at the bar! I found her to be incredibly&nbsp;evolved&nbsp;and was really proud of how she handled herself with Blake.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 data-characters=94 data-current-count=94 data-injectable=false>He concluded with an ear-to-ear grin, “Everyone is rooting for ‘Baby Jess!'”</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false>Heading into the finale of Bachelor In Paradise season 9 with no real connections on the beach (despite giving her rose to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanner Courtad</a>, indicating that she wants to explore their relationship further), what does the future have in store for Jess Girod?
