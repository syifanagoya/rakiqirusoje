The picture – which was shared on Instagram – showed baby Psalm sleeping in his cot, dressed in a white Babygro.

The reality TV star shared the happy news on Twitter, writing: "He's here and he's perfect!" Kim's post racked up 27,000 likes in less than ten minutes, with fans declaring they couldn't wait to hear the name and see the first picture.

She then added: "I was truthfully thinking about just naming him Rob, my brother Rob, but then it's like, North, Saint, Chicago, Rob - it doesn't really go."</p><p id=eWuv2pzpTqSA data-wc=1><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Gordon Ramsay embarrasses daughter on TV</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7bee43e4aead-kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e4mfD4ef68M8 data-wc=10><strong>Kim and Kayne are the proud parents of four children</strong></p><p id=eeqm2gNpjkc5 data-wc=61>Kim had shared the first photo of Psalm on American Mother's Day, choosing to post a sweet screenshot of a text message conversation from Kayne.
