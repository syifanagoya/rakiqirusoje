Read on for more…</p><h2>Ridge Is the Worst</h2><p>Ridge has become that character who, simply by walking in a room, makes situations worse. Brooke and Taylor’s friendship pact (and <a href=# rel=noopener>potential romance)</a> could have given us all kinds of story, but no, because… Ridge. Instead, we got the 10,432 reunion of Brooke and Ridge, which even the show isn’t all that into, as evidenced by the fact that they haven’t even mentioned tying the knot again for ages. We all know that when this show truly loves a couple, they’re rushed into the Forrester living room for a Carter special (aka a quickie wedding) and then… well, then sent to the backburner.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ridge-Liam-reminder-HW.jpg alt="B&B Liam Ridge " width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=wp-caption-text>“You want to see a real waffler in action? Step aside, young man.”</p><p id=image-credit-attachment-469183 class=soaps-image-credit>Credit: Howard Wise/JPI</p><p>Anyway, for a while there, Liam reclaimed the title of — to borrow a phrase from Keith Olbermann — Worst Person in the World. But planting unwanted kisses on Steffy (and then telling Hope he would always love&nbsp;her) pales in comparison to Ridge’s latest antics.</p><h2>Can’t We All Just Get Along?</h2><p>Ever since opting not to pull the plug on his dad, Ridge has kinda sorta blamed himself… but only in such a fashion that he basically makes everyone around him say, “No, no, we forced you to keep Eric alive.” In fact, the way he went from “That’s it! We’re pulling the plug!” to “Nah, never mind” is the life-or-death equivalent of his bouncing between Taylor and Brooke. The only upside? This won’t go on for years. (Although this week’s scenes were so repetitive, it kinda felt that way.)</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Who is Xander Avant and why does he matter now?</a></p><p>But what really cinched his W.P.I.T.W. title for me this week was the way he dealt with Zende. When the eager beaver came in, all bright-eyed and bushy tailed and wanting to finish Eric’s fashion line, it was a no-brainer. All Ridge had to do was say, “You know, R.J. and I were just discussing that very thing. How cool would it be for the three of us to unite to make my dad’s vision come to life?”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Eric’s “last words” were be kind to each other 🙄 yeah. They are being real kind to Zende</p><p>— Meganlennox (@Meganlennox340) <a href=# rel=nofollow>December 22, 2023</a></p><p>But noooo. Ridge basically told his nephew, “Get lost, kiddo.” Is it any wonder that Zende feels like the Black sheep of the family?(And while I know this will never come to pass, I can’t help wishing that they would pursue that angle. Stop dancing around the topic and let Zende openly question whether it’s because he’s Black. Would it make some people — both on the show and in the audience — uncomfortable? Without doubt. Which is exactly what makes it worth doing. But the odds of this particular soap ever going that route are right up there with them introducing a gay fashion designer.</p><p><strong>More: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Which One Chicago show has had the best holiday episode?</a></p><h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2><p>On the surface, it appears that Eric is on his way back to his loved ones… Friday’s ending had him waking up, much to the relief of everyone by his bedside. He even uttered “Merry Christmas.” But I’m not sure I’d start celebrating just yet. For two solid weeks, Ridge has been worried about the possibility of Eric suffering long-term consequences of the experimental procedure. Given the huge dramatic possibility this storyline would present, I can’t help but hope it comes to pass.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/JPI_Episode9165_0002058625.jpg alt='John McCook"The Bold and the Beautiful" Set CBS Television City Los Angeles, Ca. 11/01/23 © Howard Wise/jpistudios.com 310-657-9661 Episode # 9165 U.S.Airdate 12/11/23' width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=wp-caption-text>“If they’re going to keep repeating the same lines over and over, go ahead, pull the damn plug!”</p><p id=image-credit-attachment-710877 class=soaps-image-credit>Credit: Howard Wise/JPI</p><p>If you were a fan of the wildly-underrated series&nbsp;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&nbsp;— and even if you weren’t, stick with me here — you’ll recall that she, like Eric, went to heaven. (In her case, it was after sacrificing herself to prevent the apocalypse. Again.) Her friends yanked her back to the land of the living, but she couldn’t help resenting them for doing so. She even sang a gorgeously poignant song about the malaise which had taken over her soul since being “resurrected.” (You can hear it in the video below.)</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Did your favorites make our 2023 Best or Worst list?</a></p><p></p><p>What if the real reason&nbsp;Bold & Beautiful&nbsp;allowed us to see Eric and Stephanie briefly reunited in the afterlife was so that they could play the resentment he feels upon waking up, feeling trapped in a body he fears will never fully recover?</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Taylor… recast?&nbsp;</a></p><p>Imagine him being so resentful of Ridge that, even while recovering, he disowns Ridge — who is Massimo’s biological child, after all — and boots him from the company.
